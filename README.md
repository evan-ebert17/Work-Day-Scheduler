## Purpose  
This project is a web-based planner that you can use to write notes and save them based on a 9 to 9 day. Everything highlighted in green is your day to come, red is the current hour and grey has already happened. Wheever you click the save button, you are alerted that you have saved. From there, you may refresh your page, whatever you'd like, and your notes will stay there.

## Features 
CSS that changes based on time of the day, the ability to take notes, leave the application, and come back and have it be still there.

## Technologies-Used  
Currently made with JavaScript and HTML5/CSS.

## Installation  
There is no need to install this application for use, because it is hosted at the links provided above. However, for code inspection or etc, if you have SSH Keys linked, you can simple use your terminal and clone the repo down, otherwise, the typical zip.

## Usage  
By using localStorage, we are able to have the user notes persist after they are created. Additionally, this project uses JQuery for some shorthand loading of the user-saved content to the page and to have the window load everything.

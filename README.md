## Functionality
This project is a web-based planner that you can use to write notes and save them based on a 9 to 9 day. Everything highlighted in green is your day to come, red is the current hour and grey has already happened. Wheever you click the save button, you are alerted that you have saved. From there, you may refresh your page, whatever you'd like, and your notes will stay there.

## Code
By using localStorage, we are able to have the user notes persist after they are created. Additionally, this project uses JQuery for some shorthand loading of the user-saved content to the page and to have the window load everything.
